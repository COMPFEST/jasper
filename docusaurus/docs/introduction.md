Learn how to include Jasper in your project

## Installation

The best way to consume Jasper is via the npm package which you can install with npm.

```jsx
npm install --save jasper-ui
```

## Importing Components

You should import individual components rather than the entire library. Doing so pulls in only the specific components that you use, which can significantly reduce the amount of code you end up sending to the client.

```jsx
import { Button } from "jasper-ui"
```
